# About me
Front-end programmer with a passion for design, always looking for new and challenging projects.

My current skillset goes far as:
- 📖 Analysis and Systems Development (2026)
- 🏷️ Web development focused on Front-end (HTML, SCSS, Javascript, Bootstrap)
- 📁 System and Software Architecture
- 📈 Code reusability
- 🖇️ Dynamic Typing
- 💡 UI/UX
- ⚡ Currently learning Angular and React

My work is often structured like a staircase, step by step, so all needs are filled and there're no gaps afterwards the project is done.
